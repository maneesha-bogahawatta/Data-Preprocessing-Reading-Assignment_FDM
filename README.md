🚗 Electric Vehicle Data Preprocessing Project


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the data preprocessing of an Electric Vehicle (EV) dataset. The dataset contains technical specifications, performance metrics, operating costs, and categorical attributes such as make, model, region, vehicle type, and usage type.

The main target variable is:
Resale_Value_USD – representing the resale value of EVs in US dollars.

The goal of this project is to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for predictive modeling and regression analysis.


📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Numerical Features: Battery Capacity, Battery Health, Range, Mileage, Charging Time, etc.

Categorical Features: Make, Model, Region, Vehicle Type, Usage Type.

Target Variable: Resale_Value_USD.


🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

Handling Missing Values – Checked for null values; applied imputation strategies if necessary.

Feature Categorization – Separated numerical and categorical features.

Encoding Categorical Features – Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical form.

Outlier Detection – Identified extreme values using boxplots and z-scores.

Feature Scaling – Standardized numerical features using z-score normalization.

Final Dataset Preparation – Produced a machine-learning–ready dataset with scaled numerical features, encoded categorical variables, and the target column.
